### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Chris, an undergraduate student at Brown University concentrating in Health/Human Biology and Computer Science. I love to play around with data and find answers to questions I develop on my own. The pinned repositories on my profile contain my code from online courses and projects. I specialize in python and data analytics. If you want to learn more about me and what I do, check out my
